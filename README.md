# 30 Days of Nature
> A simple app built with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose - my own project for the [Android Basics with Compose](https://developer.android.com/courses/android-basics-compose/unit-3) course,
> as the demo of the skills that have been acquired in the Unit 3.
>
> The app displays 30 beautiful nature cards, each followed by a quote (mostly famous literary quotes). All the photos in the cards are taken by me.
>
> Each card shows where the picture was taken when the user expands it.
>
> The app supports both light and dark modes.
